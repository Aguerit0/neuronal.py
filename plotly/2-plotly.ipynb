To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in\n            the case of using high `opacity` values for example a\n            value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and\n            0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple\n            transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in\n            depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved\n            in the near future and is subject to change.\n        reversescale\n            Reverses the color mapping if true.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        vertexcolor\n            Sets the color of each vertex Overrides \"color\". While\n            Red, green and blue colors are in the range of 0 and\n            255; in the case of having vertex color data in RGBA\n            format, the alpha color should be normalized to be\n            between 0 and 1.\n        vertexcolorsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `vertexcolor`.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

In\n            case the `delaunayaxis` intersects the mesh surface at\n            more than one point it will result triangles that are\n            very long in the dimension of `delaunayaxis`.

In case `colorscale` is unspecified or\n            `autocolorscale` is true, the default palette will be\n            chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`\n            array are all positive, all negative or mixed.\n        cauto\n            Determines whether or not the color domain is computed\n            with respect to the input data (here `intensity`) or\n            the bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax` Defaults to `false`\n            when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.\n        cmax\n            Sets the upper bound of the color domain.

It can be used for plotting\n            fields on meshes.\n        intensitymode\n            Determines the source of `intensity` values.\n        intensitysrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `intensity`.\n        isrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `i`.\n        j\n            A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between\n            0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing\n            the \"second\" vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m],\n            j[m], k[m]}`  together represent face m (triangle m) in\n            the mesh, where `j[m] = n` points to the triplet\n            `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,\n            each element in `j` represents a point in space, which\n            is the second vertex of a triangle.\n        jsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `j`.\n        k\n            A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between\n            0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing\n            the \"third\" vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m],\n            j[m], k[m]}` together represent face m (triangle m) in\n            the mesh, where `k[m] = n` points to the triplet\n            `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,\n            each element in `k` represents a point in space, which\n            is the third vertex of a triangle.\n        ksrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `k`.\n        legendgroup\n            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of\n            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when\n            toggling legend items.\n        legendgrouptitle\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.Legendgrouptitle`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        legendrank\n            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups\n            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while\n            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on\n            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items.\n        lighting\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.Lighting` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        lightposition\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.Lightposition`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in\n            the case of using high `opacity` values for example a\n            value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and\n            0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple\n            transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in\n            depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved\n            in the near future and is subject to change.\n        reversescale\n            Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`\n            will correspond to the last color in the array and\n            `cmax` will correspond to the first color.\n        scene\n            Sets a reference between this trace's 3D coordinate\n            system and a 3D scene. If \"scene\" (the default value),\n            the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If\n            \"scene2\", the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to\n            `layout.scene2`, and so on.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        showscale\n            Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for\n            this trace.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.Stream` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets the text elements associated with the vertices. If\n            trace `hoverinfo` contains a \"text\" flag and\n            \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        vertexcolor\n            Sets the color of each vertex Overrides \"color\". While\n            Red, green and blue colors are in the range of 0 and\n            255; in the case of having vertex color data in RGBA\n            format, the alpha color should be normalized to be\n            between 0 and 1.\n        vertexcolorsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `vertexcolor`.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the X coordinates of the vertices. The nth element\n            of vectors `x`, `y` and `z` jointly represent the X, Y\n            and Z coordinates of the nth vertex.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format.
